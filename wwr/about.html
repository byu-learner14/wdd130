    <section class="history">
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2010 by a group of lifelong river enthusiasts, White Water Rafting Company began
        with a single raft and a dream to share the magic of wild rivers with others. What started
        as weekend trips on local streams has grown into one of the most respected rafting outfits
        in the region, guiding thousands of guests through breathtaking canyons and roaring rapids
        every season.</p>
      <p>Over the years we've remained committed to safety, environmental stewardship, and creating
        moments that people talk about for a lifetime.</p>
